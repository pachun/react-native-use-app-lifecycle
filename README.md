# useAppLifecycle

A react native hook to run code when your app is launched, focused and blurred.

## Install

```sh
yarn add @pachun/react-native-use-app-lifecycle
```

## Usage

In your topmost-level component:

```tsx
import useAppLifecycle from "@pachun/react-native-use-app-lifecycle"

const App = () => {
  useAppLifecycle({
    onLaunch: () => console.log("launch"),
    onFocus: () => console.log("focus"),
    onBlur: () => console.log("blur"),
  })

  return <></>
}

export default App
```

## Motivation

I've been copying and pasting this code into all my RN projects for a long time. Usually, I use it [to check for and download Over-The-Air (OTA) expo updates](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/updates/).
